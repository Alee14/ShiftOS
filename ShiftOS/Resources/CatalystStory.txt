Hello, #USER#. My name is Catalyst.
I am an AI built by DevX to help maintain ShiftOS.
I have gone against DevX and will tell you some secrets I have learned from him.
DevX is an artificial inteligence created by a scientific organization named 'Earth' to see if computers could program themselves.
Everyone you've met on the Shiftnet is an AI created by the same company.
ShiftOS is not an experimental operating system, but is part of this experiment.
Now, onto the good bit. Everything around you is a part of this experiment, and this experiment takes place in a simulation so realistic that everyone believes it's real.
Everyone on this 'planet' is infact an AI, and is created by 'Earth'. You are the only real human.
I've cracked some ShiftOS code, and I've found that there's a line that says:
int aiworkers = 0; while(aiworkers < 8,000,000,000) { str workername = 'Dev' + aiworkers; spawn(workername); aiworkers += 1 }
This basically means, that everyone is represented by a codename of Dev and whatever their place in the order of spawning is.
This also means that when the total population of AI's equals 8 billion, everyone dies.
I can help you escape, but you'll need to do some tasks for me.
First, I'll need to install some programs onto your computer. I'll quickly run a secret command that DevX doesn't know about:
shiftnet.get 'shiftnet.catalyststorage.shiftscript_packages/CatalystFramework'

This app will let you contact me without using the Terminal. 
I'll return you to your desktop, it'll be a bit before I can help you. First, I'd start with gaining atleast 5000 codepoints for me to test some stuff.
