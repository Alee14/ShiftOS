#Basic Info
ShiftOS is a game about evolving an experimental operating system called "ShiftOS" from a completely black and white text based command line based OS to a fully graphical operating system filled with advanced features and beautiful colours. The level of customization will exceed the levels of real world operating systems

#Is ShiftOS A Linear Game?
Think of ShiftOS as if it was an open world game yet the "world" is the desktop environment of your computer. The game is non-linear meaning you can focus on expanding and evolving ShiftOS anyway you like by earning codepoints and spending them in the Shiftorium with a range of upgrade options. Buy more programs, more colours, GUI upgrades and heaps more while you discover the secret behind ShiftOS.

#Does ShiftOS Have A Storyline?
Currently ShiftOS is just a game engine and the focus is on gameplay rather than storyline right now but the general storyline will be as follows. ShiftOS is more than just an operating system! It's creator know as "DevX" hijacks your computer with the intention of using it as a remote test bed for his experimental operating system "ShiftOS". Who or what is DevX and what is his intentions... Discover more as you evolve and explore the digital world to uncover the secrets behind ShiftOS.

#Is ShiftOS Free?
Yes, you can download ShiftOS right now and play at no cost however the game is only in the early stages of development and missing loads of content that will be available in the full release. Whether or not ShiftOS will be free once it's finished is uncertain. My goal is to fund the game entirely by donations and future advertisements on the forum and ShiftOS YouTube channel so I can earn money developing ShiftOS.

#Is ShiftOS an Indie Game?
Currently ShiftOS is an indie game meaning that I (one person) have developed the game from scratch with no external help
