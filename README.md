ShiftOS
=======
ShiftOS is a game about evolving an experimental operating system called
"ShiftOS" from a completely black and white text based command line based OS
to a fully graphical operating system filled with advanced features and
beautiful colours. The level of customization will exceed the levels of real
world operating systems.

Although this repository is used for archival and may be replaced by [Project Orion](http://www.github.com/ShiftOS/Project-Orion), it may still be worked on.

spending them in the Shiftorium with a range of upgrade options. Buy more 
programs, more colours, GUI upgrades and heaps more while you discover the 
secret behind ShiftOS.

Death of the original ShiftOS source code
-----------------------------------------
The original ShiftOS has been written in Visual Basic with not so much love. 
This has caused the code to be quite not intuitive to work with. Several 
attempts to make ShiftOS better developable since 2014.

### "Cleanup"
This has been the first attempt to clean the ShiftOS code, and the only attempt 
based on the original code. It has been lead by 
[rezedus](https://github.com/rezedus) but has fallen into silence when creating 
a central class for window borders. Its code is still available in the "cleanup" 
branch.

### [shift-redux](https://github.com/ShiftOS/shift-redux)
A ShiftOS clone based on TypeScript and NW.js. At this moment the repository is 
in a skeleton state. The spooky skeletons are present and ready to provide a 
base for a ShiftOS clone that doesn't get as messy as the original. It's 
developed by [phillips1012](https://github.com/phillips1012).

### [shiftos-cs](https://github.com/ShiftOS/shiftos-cs)
ShiftOS rewrite in C# lead by [rezedus](https://github.com/rezedus). It aims to
be fully customizable by JSON files which would be automatically compiled to
.cs files on build before compiling the actual executable.
