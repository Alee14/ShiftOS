Death of the original ShiftOS source code
-----------------------------------------
The original ShiftOS has been written in Visual Basic with not so much love. This has caused the code to be quite not intuitive to work with. Several attempts to make ShiftOS better developable since 2014.

### "Cleanup"
This has been the first attempt to clean the ShiftOS code, and the only attempt based on the original code. It has been lead by [rezedus](https://github.com/rezedus) but has fallen into silence when creating a central class for window borders. Its code is still available in the "cleanup" branch.

### [Project Orion](https://github.com/ShiftOS/Project-Orion)
This is a rewrite of ShiftOS in scratch, yet still in Visual Basic. It has been started in April 2015 and is lead by [TheUltimateHacker](https://github.com/TheUltimateHacker). Many hopes are being put in this rewrite.

### [shift-redux](https://github.com/ShiftOS/shift-redux)
A ShiftOS clone based on TypeScript and NW.js. At this moment the repository is in a skeleton state. The spooky skeletons are present and ready to provide a base for a ShiftOS clone that doesn't get as messy as the original. It's developed by [phillips1012](https://github.com/phillips1012).
